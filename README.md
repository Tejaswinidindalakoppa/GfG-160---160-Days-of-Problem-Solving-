# GfG-160---160-Days-of-Problem-Solving-

Welcome to this Repository where I’m documenting my journey through the GeeksforGeeks 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving Challenge! 🧑‍💻✨

Over the next 160 days, I’ll be solving a new coding problem every single day 🔥, covering everything from Arrays to Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Bit Manipulation, and much more. This challenge is all about leveling up my problem-solving skills, building consistency, and preparing for coding interviews. 📈🎯

I’m excited to dive deep into algorithms, write efficient solutions, and grow my understanding of computer science. Join me as I take on this epic coding journey! 🌍💻

🚀 About the Challenge
The GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of Problem Solving Challenge is designed to help individuals become more consistent in problem-solving and strengthen their understanding of algorithms and data structures. The goal is to solve one problem every day for 160 days, tackling different areas like arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graph theory, and much more.

🥳 Why I'm Excited:
Consistency: It forces me to solve at least one problem a day, helping me build a regular coding habit. 🧑‍💻
Diverse Problems: The problems range from easy to hard, ensuring a steady increase in difficulty and exposure to new concepts. 🔥
Improved Problem-Solving Skills: It pushes me to think critically and write efficient solutions. 💡
Community and Learning: GeeksforGeeks has a vibrant community of coders. Let’s learn and grow together! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
